    <h2>HTML(Hyper text markup language)</h2>
    <img src="image.png"  width="200" height="200" align="right" alt="html">
    <p>HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
     Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. 
     HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.
     HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. 
     HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.
     A form of HTML, known as HTML5, together with js.

    <h2 align="right">CSS(Cascading Style Sheets)</h2>
    <img src="image copy.png"  width="200" height="200" align="left" alt="css">
    <p align="right">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).
    CSS  is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.
    This separation can improve content accessibility;[further explanation needed] provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
    Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices.

    <h2 align="left">JS(JavaScript)</h2>
    <img src="image copy 2.png" width="200" height="200" align="right" alt="js">
    <p align="left">JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of the Web,alongside HTML and CSS. 99% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior.
     Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the client code.These engines are also utilized in some servers and a variety of apps. 
    The most popular runtime system for non-browser usage is Node.js.JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[11] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).

    <h2 align="right">Node JS</h2>
    <img src="image copy 3.png" width="200" height="200" align="left" alt="nodejs">
    <p align="right">Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more. Node.js runs on the V8 JavaScript engine, and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.
     Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting. The ability to run JavaScript code on the server is often used to generate dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.
     Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying web-application.Node.js has an event-driven architecture capable of asynchronous I/O. 
     These design choices aim to optimize throughput and scalability in web applications with many input/output operations, as well as for real-time Web applications (e.g., real-time communication programs and browser games).
     The Node.js distributed development project was previously governed by the Node.js Foundation,and 
     has now merged with the JS Foundation to form the OpenJS Foundation.

     <h2 align="left">PHP</h2>
     <img src="image copy 4.png" width="200" height="200" align="right" alt="php">
     <p align="left">PHP is a general-purpose scripting language geared towards web development. It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1993 and released in 1995.The PHP reference implementation is now produced by the PHP Group. PHP was originally an abbreviation of Personal Home Page, but it now stands for the recursive initialism PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.[14]
    PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module,
    a daemon or a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable.PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon or a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code—which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data—would form the whole or part of an HTTP response. 
    Various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks exist that can be employed to orchestrate or facilitate the generation of that response.

Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside the web context, 
    such as standalone graphical applications and drone control. PHP code can also be directly executed from the command line.
